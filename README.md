# Sparking Great Ideas

### Catalyst is a community-driven web application in which users can create and join Collectives - forums in which they can exchange ideas with like-minded individuals.
### A love song of sorts to Slack and Discord, Catalyst features a sleek and intuitive design that emphasizes connection while minimizing distractions.  

  
### The client-side of the application is built in React.js, while database and token operations are carried out via CORS and JSON using a Django REST API backend. [Catalyst's backend repository can be found here.](https://github.com/Vilem-McKael/catalyst-django)
